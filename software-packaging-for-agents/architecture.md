# Architecture (framing skeleton)

The project is a **closed cycle** of six tracks. Only **measure** is built
today (as [`../doc-benchmark/`](../doc-benchmark/)); the others are the subject
of this directory. The cycle matters more than any single track: artifacts are
authored, proven, shipped, found, *used*, and the evidence from real use flows
back to re-author and re-score them.

## Tracks

1. **Author** — manufacture the artifacts at scale: distill a thin Tier-1
   `SKILL.md` from a library's docs and iterate it against the benchmark, and
   produce the executable **setup guide** (environment bootstrap) that HPC
   agents actually need. Today only one skill exists, hand-written. Design:
   [`authoring.md`](authoring.md).
2. **Build** — assemble the authored artifacts into an agent configuration
   (`AgentConfig`: system prompt + skills + mcp + tools). Today these exist as
   benchmark fixtures (`../doc-benchmark/data/agent_profiles/`,
   `../doc-benchmark/data/skills/`).
3. **Measure** — `doc-benchmark/`. The scorecard is the gate: only artifacts
   that demonstrably improve answers/task outcomes get packaged. The scorecard
   carries *both* Q&A-judge deltas and behavioral terminal-bench pass-rates.
4. **Package** — serialize the agent configuration (+ scorecard + provenance)
   into a manifest and export it per runtime (Claude plugin, Anthropic Agent
   Skills layout, Hermes, generic). Design: [`packaging.md`](packaging.md).
5. **Discover** — a capability/intent graph with semantic search so niche tools
   surface by *fit*, not popularity. Design: [`discovery.md`](discovery.md).
6. **Serve** — the runtime where an agent loads a package, the two-tier BKM
   runs (thin skill → on-demand MCP), and real usage emits telemetry. The graph
   doubles as a **router** across a fleet of packaged experts. Design:
   [`serving.md`](serving.md).

## The feedback loop closes the cycle

A scorecard stamped once at build time goes stale. The loop makes it **living**
(design: [`feedback.md`](feedback.md)):

- **Serve → Measure.** Real questions and observed failures from production
  become new golden questions in the existing `personas`/`questions` track;
  re-scoring keeps the credential current.
- **Upstream-docs → Package.** The static `freshness_lite` signal marks a
  package's scorecard *stale* when a library's docs change, triggering CI
  re-evaluation and re-packaging.
- **Telemetry → Author.** Where agents loop, mis-trigger a skill, or work around
  a gap tells the authoring track what to distill or fix next.

## Key idea: AgentConfig is already a package

`doc-benchmark`'s `Treatment` → `AgentConfig` abstraction
(`../doc-benchmark/doc_benchmarks/treatments/base.py`) is
`system_prompt + skills + tools + injected_context` — which is exactly a
shippable agent. Packaging is largely *serializing and adapting* this existing
representation, not inventing a new one.

## Open architectural questions

Tracked in the branch plan; to be resolved with design docs:

- Package manifest schema and how the scorecard is embedded.
- Which runtimes to target first and how their adapters differ.
- Graph technology and the intent/capability taxonomy.
- Whether to ship an Intel **MCP server** or only consume third-party ones
  (today `doc-benchmark` is an MCP *client*).
