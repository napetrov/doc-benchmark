"""Failure diagnosis for documentation benchmark evaluations.

For each evaluated question, determines *why* the WITH-docs answer
scored differently from the WITHOUT-docs answer.

Diagnosis categories
--------------------
docs_helped
    delta >= 0. Documentation improved or matched the baseline.

empty_retrieval
    No documentation was retrieved at all (MCP returned nothing,
    or the source was unavailable).

below_threshold
    Docs were fetched but every chunk scored below the reranker
    threshold — none were passed to the LLM.

low_relevance
    Docs were passed to the LLM but had low keyword-overlap scores
    (top_score < LOW_RELEVANCE_CUTOFF). The retrieved content was
    likely off-topic.

knowledge_sufficient
    Docs were retrieved with reasonable relevance, but the model
    already knows enough to answer without them.  The documentation
    added noise rather than signal.

insufficient_data
    Delta could not be computed (one or both answers missing).
