# Executable task coverage (Intel oneAPI components)

This document tracks which Intel oneAPI APIs and concepts are covered by
terminal-bench-style coding tasks, and the planned gaps per component.

## oneTBB

This matrix tracks which oneTBB APIs and concepts are covered by terminal-bench-style coding tasks.

| API / concept | Task | Status | Verifier strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `parallel_sort` | `onetbb-parallel-sort` | merged | Sort correctness, runtime bound, source marker checks |
| `parallel_for` + `parallel_reduce` | `onetbb-nstream` | merged | Serial checksum comparison, source marker checks |
| `blocked_range2d` stencil update | `onetbb-stencil` | merged | Serial norm comparison, source marker checks |
| `blocked_range2d` transpose | `onetbb-transpose` | merged | Serial probe-signature comparison, source marker checks |
| `parallel_reduce` | `onetbb-parallel-reduce` | implemented | Serial aggregate comparison, source marker checks |

## Other oneAPI components

These tasks live in the separate `terminal-bench-verify-oneapi` CI job because
they pull the Intel oneAPI apt repo, header-only oneDPL from GitHub, or pip
wheels at **build** time. The verifier still runs offline (`--network none`).

| Component | API / concept | Task | Status | Verifier strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| oneMKL | `cblas_dgemm` (BLAS) | `onemkl-dgemm` | implemented | Signature (sum of `C=A*B`) vs serial triple-loop reference; runtime bound; source markers (`cblas_dgemm`, `mkl.h`) |
| oneMKL | DFTI FFT | `onemkl-fft` | implemented | Dominant-bin + magnitude-sum vs naive DFT reference, forward/backward round-trip error; source markers |
| oneDPL | `transform_reduce` + `par_unseq` | `onedpl-transform-reduce` | implemented | Sum-of-squares signature vs serial reference; runtime bound; source markers (`oneapi/dpl`, `transform_reduce`, `execution::par`) |
| IPP | `ippsDotProd_64f` | `ipp-dotprod` | implemented | Dot-product signature vs serial reference; source markers (`ippsDotProd_64f`, `ipp.h`) |
| sklearnex | `patch_sklearn()` + KNN | `sklearnex-classification` | implemented | Accuracy within 0.02 of stock scikit-learn reference; source markers (`sklearnex`, `patch_sklearn`) |

> A `oneccl-allreduce` task (multi-rank sum allreduce over MPI vs analytic
> `N*(N+1)/2`) was prototyped but pulled from the first batch: the oneCCL/Intel
> MPI transport needs iteration on a real image under `--network none`, which
> couldn't be done in the authoring sandbox. It is tracked as a candidate below.

## Intel performance skills

These tasks evaluate `intel/intel-performance-skills` as an agent capability:
the agent must interpret profile-like evidence, choose the right performance
pattern, apply a safe fix or produce a report, and pass deterministic verifier
checks. They intentionally avoid privileged `perf` in the first wave; static
profile artifacts are shipped in the task environment.

| Problem / concept | Task | Level | Status | Verifier strategy |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Serial accumulator / low IPC | `intel-perf-serial-accumulator` | diagnosis | implemented | Dot-product equality vs serial reference; speedup threshold; source marker for multiple partial accumulators |
| False sharing / HITM | `intel-perf-false-sharing` | diagnosis | implemented | Final counter total; speedup vs false-sharing baseline; source marker for cache-line separation |
| Shared statistics counter / true sharing | `intel-perf-shared-counter` | diagnosis | implemented | Exact total and checksum; speedup vs global atomic baseline; source marker for local aggregation |
| Missing C `restrict` / alias preamble | `intel-perf-missing-restrict` | diagnosis | implemented | Checksum equality; `restrict` source marker; compiler vectorization evidence |
| Hotspot report from perf artifacts | `intel-perf-hotspot-report` | end_to_end | implemented | Markdown structure checks; serial-accumulator and false-sharing observations; rejects fake fix claims |
| TAS spinlock cache-line bouncing | `intel-perf-ttas-spinlock` | diagnosis | implemented | Mutual exclusion (exact total at several thread counts); termination under high contention (no livelock); source marker for read-spin-before-exchange (TTAS) |
| Read-mostly mutex serializes readers | `intel-perf-mutex-rwlock` | diagnosis | implemented | Array checksum equals mutex reference (write path correct); termination under read load; source marker for `shared_mutex`/`shared_lock` |
| Condition-variable thundering herd | `intel-perf-cv-herd` | diagnosis | implemented | Exact job count + checksum at several worker counts; termination (no deadlock/lost wakeup); per-job path uses `notify_one`, not broadcast |
| Single-accumulator CRC32C | `intel-perf-crc32c` | diagnosis | implemented | CRC equality vs reference + known vector; >=4x throughput (measured ~14x); source marker for hardware CRC intrinsic + dispatch + scalar fallback |
| `std::sort` on primitives (stable not required) | `intel-perf-simd-sort` | diagnosis | implemented | Sortedness + same multiset signature vs reference; >=1.8x speedup (measured ~4x); rejects `std::sort` on the hot path |

> Verifier-strategy note: the concurrency tasks (`ttas-spinlock`, `mutex-rwlock`,
> `cv-herd`) gate on **correctness + structural source markers + termination**
> rather than a wall-clock speedup threshold. Spinlock/lock fairness is highly
> machine- and contention-dependent (measured TAS-vs-TTAS wall-clock ratio swung
> 0.26–1.39 on a 224-core host pinned to 4 CPUs), so a tight speedup gate would
> be flaky in CI. The deterministic single-thread throughput tasks (`crc32c`,
> `simd-sort`) keep a conservative speedup gate well below the measured margin.

## Notes for new tasks

Prefer deterministic, small workloads that can be verified offline in CI. Each
task should have a serial reference or an independently computed expected result
so verifiers reject keyword-only implementations. Runtime thresholds should be
conservative enough to avoid flaky CI while still detecting obviously
inefficient or non-terminating solutions.

Validation patterns used across components:

1. **Serial reference signature** — ship a small serial program (built in the
   Dockerfile) that computes a deterministic scalar/array signature; the
   verifier runs both and compares within a tolerance. Used by every numeric
   task here.
2. **Analytic expected value** — when a serial reference is awkward (e.g.
   collectives), derive the answer in closed form (a `oneccl-allreduce` task
   would compare against `N*(N+1)/2`).
3. **Round-trip invariants** — forward/backward transforms (FFT) or
   encrypt/decrypt (crypto) must recover the input within tolerance.
4. **Drop-in reference** — for accelerator libraries (sklearnex), compare
   against the stock library it accelerates and require the result to match
   closely.
5. **Source API markers** — grep the agent's source for the required API
   symbols/headers so a hard-coded or keyword-only answer is rejected.

For components whose dependencies are large or only available via the Intel
oneAPI apt repo, add the task to the `terminal-bench-verify-oneapi` CI job and
build/verify/cleanup one image at a time to respect the runner disk budget.
