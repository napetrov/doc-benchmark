# doc-benchmark: measure what actually helps an agent

The idea in three points:

- An agent is more than its model. It is **model + the context you give it**:
  docs, skills, MCP servers, system prompts (agent profiles), plugins.
- All of that is cheap to write — and easy to over-claim. Does it really help,
  or does it just add tokens?
- So we test it like an experiment: **change one thing, keep everything else
  fixed, measure the delta — and check it is statistically significant.**

```text
 same questions ──► │ model              │ ──► answers ──► judge ──► score A
 same questions ──► │ model + artifact   │ ──► answers ──► judge ──► score B

                    delta = B − A,  p-value = "is this real or noise?"
```

## What can be compared (arms)

| Arm | What it tests |
|---|---|
| `baseline` | the bare model (control) |
| `docs:` / `mcp:` | injected documentation (local files, URL, Context7, real MCP server) |
| `skill:` | a skill (`SKILL.md`) injected as context |
| `profile:` | an agent persona system prompt |
| `agent:` / `skill-agent:` | **agentic** use — the model gets a tool and *decides* whether to fetch docs / load the skill |

Two fine-print notes:

- Plugins (e.g. `plugin:caveman`) are not arms — they go in via `--plugins`
  and apply to every arm in the run.
- Set `--judge-model` / `--judge-provider` to a different model than the
  answerer; the CLI defaults both to the same model, and self-judging
  inflates scores.

## Example results

One skill, four models, same golden question set:

| Model | WITH skill | WITHOUT skill | Delta | p-value | Significant? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Haiku 4.5 | 66.3 | 56.8 | **+9.5** | 0.0024 | ✅ yes |
| Opus 4.7 | 78.5 | 73.6 | +4.9 | 0.0842 | ❌ |
| Sonnet 4.6 | 74.3 | 69.9 | +4.4 | 0.1797 | ❌ |
| Opus 4.8 | 80.8 | 78.1 | +2.7 | 0.1530 | ❌ |

What this table teaches:

- **Value depends on the model.** The same skill is worth +9.5 to a small
  model and +2.7 to a frontier one — stronger models already know more.
- **No p-value, no claim.** Three deltas are positive but not significant —
  at this sample size they may be judge noise.
- **The conclusion is targeted.** Ship this skill where it provably helps
  (smaller/cheaper models); gather more data for the rest.

*Where the stats come from:* the two-arm (with/without) reports compute the
paired t-test, Wilcoxon, and Cohen's d; the N-way `arms run` report shows
average scores and deltas vs baseline (use `scripts/compare_models.py` for
baseline-vs-one-treatment significance). The full `benchmark run` pipeline
also records a `question_set_hash` to prove question-set reuse across runs.

## How the evaluation flows

```text

  scorecard: "worth +X on model M (p = …)" — ship it or cut it
```

Two more tracks back this up:

- **Static track** — LLM-free checks on the docs themselves: structure,
  freshness, readability, do the code examples run.
- **Executable task track** — [`terminal-bench-tasks/`](../terminal-bench-tasks/):
  the agent must edit code, compile, and pass tests in Docker. A judge can be
  fooled by prose; a pytest verifier cannot.

## Why this matters

Marketplaces rank agent artifacts by popularity, which buries niche expert
tooling (focus here: Intel performance libraries — oneTBB, oneDAL, oneMKL).
Here, every shipped skill, doc source, or profile carries the **scorecard
that earned it**, kept alive as models and docs change. See the
[umbrella README](../../README.md) for the bigger
author → build → **measure** → package → discover → serve cycle.

# Documentation index

Start with the top-level [README](../README.md) for the project overview and
CLI surface. The files in this directory go deeper:

## Using doc-benchmark

- [quickstart.md](quickstart.md) — end-to-end LLM evaluation pipeline:

  static, LLM, and executable-task tracks.
- [contributing-metric.md](contributing-metric.md) — add a new static
