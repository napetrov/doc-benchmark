"""Tools offered to the model during agentic treatment arms.

These let the model *decide* to use a capability rather than receiving
pre-injected context: query an MCP doc server, or load a skill on demand
(progressive disclosure — the model first sees only the skill's name and
one-line description, and calls the tool to read the full body).

Faithful skill *script execution* deliberately does not live here: running
bundled scripts needs real sandboxing and belongs on the terminal-bench task
track. These tools are read-only.
