Library: {library_name}
Question: {question}

Classify this question on two dimensions:

1. **Difficulty** — Choose ONE:
   - beginner: Basic usage, installation, simple how-to, terminology
   - intermediate: Integration, configuration, common patterns, troubleshooting
   - advanced: Internals, performance tuning, edge cases, architecture decisions

2. **Trivial** — Would an LLM answer this correctly WITHOUT reading the library docs?
   - true: The answer is general knowledge (e.g., "what is a thread?")
   - false: The answer requires library-specific documentation

Respond with ONLY valid JSON (no explanation):

{{"difficulty": "beginner|intermediate|advanced", "trivial": true|false, "reason": "one sentence"}}
