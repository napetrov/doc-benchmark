"""Multi-agent panel review of generated questions.

Three reviewers with distinct perspectives evaluate each question:
- domain_expert:  Is this question technically accurate and meaningful?
- user_advocate:  Would a real developer actually ask this?
- qa_engineer:    Can this question be objectively evaluated / scored?

Each reviewer scores 0-100 on their primary dimension + flags issues.
Python aggregates the scores; LLM never computes weighted average.
